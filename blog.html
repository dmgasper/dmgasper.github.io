		<h2>Assignment 1</h2>
		<h4>4/6/2020</h4>
		<p>I struggled this week with adjusting to my current course schedule, and as a result I started this assignment later than I wanted to. Other than that, though, I thought that this assignment was fairly simple. I learned basic HTML document structure and elements such as head/body groupings, headers, paragraphs, and lists. I found the assignment specification and the lecture notes on HTML to be most helpful in completing this assignment. I kept these resources open on half of my screen while I worked on the assignment on the other half.</p>
		<h2>Assignment 2</h2>
		<h4>4/24/2020</h4>
		<p>I spent a considerable amount of time this week trying to understand the sheer number of keywords that CSS offers, and the interactions between those keywords. However, once I started to establish this knowledge I found creating the stylesheet fairly straightforward. I experienced trouble with the flexbox behavior and adjusting the margins within each twit, but I started to appreciate the robustness of the flexbox once I managed to recreate the mock's behavior. Having previously only created web pages using HTML, I am glad to now have this knowledge of CSS to style my web pages.</p>
		<h2>Assignment 3</h2>
		<h4>5/11/2020</h4>
		<p>I had a basic familiarity with Javascript going into this project, and as a result I had no problem understanding the Javascript syntax. Additionally, I was able to use the lecture materials as a reference whenever I needed to implement a feature that I did not know how to implement. The greatest challenge for me was having the search box function correctly. I discovered an issue where twits would be filtered incorrectly due to the last character of the search query being omitted. I think that this assignment was very useful for learning how to create dynamic content on a webpage. I did not know how to add this functionality previously, and now I have the ability to create websites that are much more feature-rich than before.</p>
		<h2>Assignment 4</h2>
		<h4>5/17/2020</h4>
		<p>This assignment was probably the most difficult assignment for me so far, as I have never worked with server-side development before. I found it interesting that JavaScript, which I previously had thought of as a client-side framework, could be run browser-independent in a server application. I did not understand how to implement the cache initially, but after some research I discovered the Object object in Javascript. Using this object, I could save page data in an array-like structure and assign each save a named index corresponding to the page's location on the filesystem. In this way I was able to implement a simple cache without adding an excessive amount of logic to my code. An issue that I am currently observing with the test code is that it fails to determine the process PID for my node server, causing the port listening tests to fail when I have manually confirmed that the PORT environment variable affects the listening port.</p>

		<h2>Assignment 5</h2>
		<h4>6/3/2020</h4>
		<p>I initially encountered difficulty with the cloning of the Github repository for this project. Due to some unknown cause, rather than receiving the starter code and assignment description I instead received an empty repository. I solved this problem buy aquiring the starter code from another member of the class. I found templating to be fairly simple once I understood the basic syntax and file tree structure. I looked at the example code and lecture notes frequently while working on this assignment in order to understand how the various template files interface with the server.js file and the node.js server.</p>
