		<h2>Assignment 1</h2>
		<h4>4/6/2020</h4>
		<p>I struggled this week with adjusting to my current course schedule, and as a result I started this assignment later than I wanted to. Other than that, though, I thought that this assignment was fairly simple. I learned basic HTML document structure and elements such as head/body groupings, headers, paragraphs, and lists. I found the assignment specification and the lecture notes on HTML to be most helpful in completing this assignment. I kept these resources open on half of my screen while I worked on the assignment on the other half.</p>
		<h2>Assignment 2</h2>
		<h4>4/24/2020</h4>
		<p>I spent a considerable amount of time this week trying to understand the sheer number of keywords that CSS offers, and the interactions between those keywords. However, once I started to establish this knowledge I found creating the stylesheet fairly straightforward. I experienced trouble with the flexbox behavior and adjusting the margins within each twit, but I started to appreciate the robustness of the flexbox once I managed to recreate the mock's behavior. Having previously only created web pages using HTML, I am glad to now have this knowledge of CSS to style my web pages.</p>
